### 1. Choose a subject
Pick your poison and begin by writing down everything you know about the topic. Next, find your resources like youtube, LinkedIn learning, or any book on the subject, and take notes.

### 2. Explain it to a 5-year-old
Remove all jargon and complexity from the description or definition of the subject. Explain the topic to a five-year-old this will show a deeper level of our understanding of the topic. We'll focus on simplifying the topic and all related material. 

### 3. Identify gaps in knowledge
Be honest with yourself, where do you think you've screwed up or do not fully understand? Be brave! Go back and review the material connecting the new knowledge gained to your current understanding of the subject.

### 4. Review and Simplify
Don't be shy! Ask yourself some questions, and add any visual or auditory aids to help reinforce your understanding. If you're a programmer, you should also practice, practice, practice.
